## Behavior Notes

### Pane Focus Model

The UI has three panes with visual focus indication:
1. **Sidebar** - Account/folder list
2. **Message List** - Conversations in selected folder
3. **Conversation Viewer** - Selected conversation content

Clicking a pane focuses it. Focus is indicated by a subtle border flash animation.

### Folder Navigation

`Alt+Up/Down` navigates through all folders in visual order:
1. Unified Inbox (All Inboxes)
2. Individual account inboxes under Unified Inbox
3. Account 1 header
4. Account 1 folders (if expanded)
5. Account 2 header
6. Account 2 folders (if expanded)
7. ... and so on

Collapsed accounts show only their header (not folders) in navigation.

### Message Actions Hierarchy

Action shortcuts (Delete, Archive, Spam, Star, Read/Unread) follow this priority:

1. **Checked messages** - If any messages are checked (via Space or Shift+navigation), actions apply to ALL checked messages
2. **Keyboard-focused message** - Otherwise, actions apply to the message that's currently focused in the message list (the one with keyboard highlight from j/k navigation)
3. The message being viewed in the conversation pane is independent - you can navigate to and delete a different message without opening it first

First `Escape` clears checkboxes, second `Escape` closes the conversation viewer.

### Composer Blocking

When the composer is open:
- `Ctrl+R`, `Ctrl+Shift+R`, `Ctrl+F` are blocked to prevent accidental replies
- Other global shortcuts continue to work

### Unified Inbox

When viewing Unified Inbox and replying:
- Reply uses the account associated with the selected message
- This ensures replies come from the correct email address
